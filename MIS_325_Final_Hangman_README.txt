Hangman

This program is a simple game of hangman with graphical output. Starting with a
brief explanation of the program and user input. The input is taken as a string 
and then converted to upper case for later code analysis. The graphics are setup 
as a list of strings which can be accessed and used in the primary game while loop. 
The first section of the game code is the function guesses which takes user input 
for guesses of letters in the first user input and corrects any errors in input. 
Following this a while loop sets up blanks to proper length and orients them around 
any correct user guesses. Graphics are printed and spacing is printed between user 
guesses and graphics. If else statements are used to assess the guesses which are 
incorrect to print the correct graphic and print “You have lost” there are greater 
than 5 incorrect inputs. An if statement is initialized if all letters in the word 
have been guessed and prints “You have won”. A for loop is used to print the letters 
which have been guessed. An if statement is then finally used to count incorrect 
guesses with the variable ‘wrong’.
